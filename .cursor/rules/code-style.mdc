- Prefer descriptive names; avoid 1–2 character identifiers.
- Exported functions and public APIs must have explicit types; no `any`.
- Keep edits minimal and localized; do not reformat unrelated code.
- Preserve existing indentation and whitespace.
- Use early returns; avoid deep nesting; avoid broad try/catch that swallow errors.
