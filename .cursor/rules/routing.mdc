- Route patterns allowed: `/`, `/:state`, `/:state/:district`, `/inserate`, `/:state/inserate`, `/:state/:district/inserate`.
- Loaders must validate params, call services, and set appropriate cache headers.
- Components should rely on loader data; avoid client-side fetching.
- React router 7 generates type definitions for the routes. Use them to validate the params and query in the loader functions. Use `pnpm run rr:generate` to generate the type definitions when you change the routes.
